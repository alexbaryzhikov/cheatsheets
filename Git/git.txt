-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DISTRIBUTED WORKFLOW

    # Create a local branch and setup upstream confuguration
    git checkout -t -b experiment origin/experiment
    
    # Clone a repo and make clone a bare repo (no working tree, no remotes)
    git clone --bare simplegit/.git simplegit-bare.git

    git fetch origin                # Fetch objects from remote
    git pull origin/<branch>        # Fetch and merge
    git push origin <branch>        # Push branch to remote
    git push origin                 # Push all common branches
    git push --force                # Force current branch to remote (in case you diverged)
    git remote add origin <url>     # Add a remote
    git branch -u origin/<branch>   # Set upstream for current branch
    git remote show origin          # Show useful info about a remote
    git request-pull <start> <url>  # Generate a summary of pending changes

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REMOTE REPOSITORY SETUP

    mkdir bare_repo         # Create directory to contain bare repository
    cd bare_repo
    git --bare init         # Initialize bare repository

    cd ~/project1           # Dir with project files
    git init                # Initialize repo
    git add *               # Add changes from working dir to index
    git commit -m "first"   # Commit changes from index to head

    git remote add origin ~/bare_repo      # Add remote repo, label it "origin"
    git push --set-upstream origin master  # Push head -> remote repository

At this point the remote repository is set up and we can use it to merge/clone
new instances.

    git clone ~/bare_repo   # Clone repo with remote configured as "origin"
or
    mkdir new_inst          # Create dir for new instance.
    cd new_inst
    git init
    git remote add origin ~/bare_repo
    git pull origin master
    git push --set-upstream origin master

If you look at .git/config, there must be something like

    [remote "origin"]
        url = ~/bare_repo
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
    [branch "master"]
        remote = origin
        merge = refs/heads/master
